## About Project
I've got friends who are interested in web Programming, and most of them are totally new to this field. 

To help them understand how it works and make a portfolio later, and also to help me to review what I learned before, I decided to build a small project from scratch. 

Hope it also helps you visiting my blog:D

The name of the project is score-management-system. 

Yes, I'm going to make a simple web, where I can see students' scores and manage them. 

In this project, I'd like to cover below:


1. (backend) Creating springboot project
2. (backend) Managing the project with Github
3. (backend) Installing mariaDB and connecting it to the Backend
4. (backend) Practicing JPA
5. (backend) Practicing RestApi with postman
6. (frontend) creating Next.js project


It's not fixed yet and can be modified later.
